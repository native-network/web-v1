        <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
        <p>
          Native Project LLC (&ldquo;Native,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo;
          &ldquo;our,&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) is a Delaware limited
          liability company that was founded for the special purpose of
          developing a platform for communities (&ldquo;Communities&rdquo; or
          &ldquo;Community&rdquo;) to generate independent currencies backed by
          a liquid reserve, enabling them to organize local economies (the
          &ldquo;Native Ecosystem&rdquo;). &nbsp;The Native Ecosystem uses a
          reserve currency called &ldquo;Native Tokens&rdquo; that is staked
          into Communities to generate &ldquo;Community Tokens&rdquo; that
          represent the value of a Community&rsquo;s economy.
        </p>
        <p />
        <p>
          These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) are a legal agreement
          between you and Native and govern your use of Native&rsquo;s services,
          including the Native Ecosystem, Native Tokens, Community Tokens, and
          any mobile applications, websites, software, hardware, or other
          products and services developed or to be developed by Native
          (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). If you are using the
          Services on behalf of a business, you represent to us that you have
          authority to bind that business or entity to these Terms, and that
          such business accepts these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms, including
          terms that limit our liability (see Section 20) and require individual
          arbitration for any potential legal dispute (see Section 23), and
          affirm that you are of legal age to enter into this Agreement where
          you live and have the legal capacity to enter into this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES. IF YOU DO
          NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.
        </p>
        <p />
        <p>1. Services</p>
        <p>
          Our Services allow you to: (a) create and join communities
          (&ldquo;Communities&rdquo;) which are organized around common
          missions, interests, purposes, or goals; (b) communicate with other
          users for any number of purposes, including interacting on a purely
          social basis, coordinating common projects, or assigning and
          completing discrete tasks that benefit the Community or its members;
          and (c) use other features to be developed by Native.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to join a Community, you must first possess Native Tokens,
          which you can obtain in a decentralized manner upon demand by
          interfacing with a smart contract administered by Bancor, a third
          party not affiliated with Native (&ldquo;Bancor&rdquo;). &nbsp;This is
          achieved by delivering Ether (or certain other Ethereum-based tokens)
          to Bancor, which programmatically exchanges the Ether for Native
          Tokens through a smart contract at a conversion rate determined by
          Bancor.&nbsp; After conversion of the Ether by Bancor, you will
          possess Native Tokens, with which they can join one or more
          Communities. &nbsp;The Native Platform itself does not play an active
          role in the creation of Native Tokens; Native Tokens are only created
          upon demand by you or other users interacting with Bancor, and Native
          Token conversion rates are determined by Bancor&rsquo;s algorithm
          which takes into account a number of factors, including but not
          limited to the amount of Native Tokens in existence and the amount of
          Ether in the Native Reserve Fund (as described below).
        </p>
        <p>
          To become a member of a specific Community, you must hold a
          pre-determined number of Community Tokens. &nbsp;If you hold the
          requisite number of Community Tokens, you can join the Community by
          staking that number of Community Tokens with the Community, which is
          akin to a membership fee; once a member of the Community, you can join
          and participate in the Community&rsquo;s localized, digital community.
          &nbsp;{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          Community Tokens are derived from Native Tokens upon demand by you or
          other users interacting with Bancor. This is achieved by delivering
          Native Tokens to Bancor, which programmatically converts the Native
          Tokens into Community Tokens at a conversion rate determined by
          Bancor.&nbsp; After conversion of the Native Token by Bancor, you will
          possess Community Tokens. &nbsp;Neither the Native Platform nor any
          Community plays an active role in the creation of Community Tokens -
          they are only created upon demand by you or other users interacting
          with Bancor. The Native Token-to-Community Token conversion rate is
          determined by Bancor&rsquo;s algorithm which takes into account a
          number of factors, including but not limited to the amount of
          Community Tokens in existence and the amount of Native Tokens in the
          Community Reserve (as described below).
        </p>
        <p>
          You, or a group of users, may eventually establish and operate a
          Community on Native, provided the founders of the Community comply
          with Native&rsquo;s rules and processes. &nbsp;Native Tokens
          allocated&nbsp;by&nbsp;Community members contribute to a Community
          Development Pool (as described below) which the Community can use to
          fund projects. &nbsp;Each Community has one or more
          &ldquo;Curators,&rdquo; and often the Community&rsquo;s founders will
          act as Curators. Curators oversee and guide the Community as it grows.
          &nbsp;Initially, Curators define the Community&rsquo;s goals, allocate
          the Community&rsquo;s funds, and solicit new members. Curators can
          create project proposals that are voted on by Community members. Aside
          from maintaining the Native platform, educating Community Curators on
          best practices to curate Communities and ensuring that Communities
          adhere to Native&rsquo;s policies and procedures, Native will have no
          role in Community decisions and management. All transactions involving
          Native and Community Tokens on the Native platform are validated and
          recorded through the Ethereum blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each Community has a dashboard that displays an overview of activity
          within the Community. &nbsp;The dashboard provides essential
          information such as token activity, project proposals, and community
          history. Community Tokens are the representation of the value, and
          form the basis of, each Community&rsquo;s &ldquo;economy&rdquo; and
          may be used to pay for and reward efforts by Community members with
          respect to Community projects, to determine projects and goals to be
          pursued by a Community, participate in Community votes, and the like.
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          A Community&rsquo;s Development Pool can grow over time as more
          members join, and members can earn rewards through participating in
          and completing Community projects or tasks and other future avenues to
          be explored, such as affinity membership of Community members with
          merchants and similar approaches to be determined by such Community.
          &nbsp;Community Tokens are also required (and will be added to a
          Community Development Pool when received) for proposing a project to a
          Community&rsquo;s curator, and marketing a project to a
          Community&rsquo;s members.
        </p>
        <p>2. Fees and Payments</p>
        <p>
          When you obtain Native Tokens through the Bancor smart contract in
          exchange for Ether (or certain other Ethereum-based tokens), 50% of
          the Ether (which can be modified over time) is sent to the pool from
          which Native derives its operating funds (the &ldquo;Native
          Development Fund&rdquo;), and 50% is diverted to a reserve pool (the
          &ldquo;Native Reserve.&rdquo;) &nbsp;The Native Reserve has two
          primary purposes. &nbsp;First, it ensures liquidity for you or other
          users who wish to exchange their Native Tokens for Ether as they
          remove funds from the Native Platform. &nbsp;Second, it ensures that
          the price of Native Tokens (and, indirectly and partially, the prices
          of the various Community Tokens) remains tethered to the price of the
          underlying base currency (which will initially be BNT (Bancor) but can
          be changed over time), and that the prices of tokens used on the
          Native platform are intended to be relatively insulated from drastic
          price fluctuations. &nbsp;In sum, the value of the Native Reserve is
          substantially dependent on the market price of Bancor, a widely
          exchanged digital asset based on a decentralized protocol.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          A similar bifurcation occurs when you obtain Community Token, with a
          portion of the Community Tokens being sent to a pool of assets for use
          by the Community (the &ldquo;Community Development Pool&rdquo;), and
          the remainder of the Community Tokens sent to the a reserve pool used
          to assist with liquidity and price stability (the &ldquo;Community
          Reserve&rdquo;). &nbsp;As with the Native Reserve, the conversion rate
          for Community Token creation or redemption is determined solely by the
          Bancor algorithm, which takes into account a number of factors, such
          as the number of Community Tokens outstanding and the number of Native
          Tokens in the Community Reserve.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for paying any applicable blockchain transaction
          and conversion fees that you may incur by using Native&rsquo;s
          services. &nbsp;Fee rates may vary, and you will be informed of any
          fees prior to incurring them.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>3. Privacy</p>
        <p>
          <br />
          You have read and consent to Native&rsquo;s&nbsp;Privacy Notice, which
          explains how we collect, use and protect the personal information you
          provide to us.
        </p>
        <p>4. Registration</p>
        <p>
          In order to use the Services, you must create a &ldquo;Native
          Account&rdquo; by registering with us and confirming your control of a
          digital wallet, in accordance with the procedures set forth on
          Native&rsquo;s website. During registration we will ask you for
          information, which may include but is not limited to, your name and
          other personal information. You must provide accurate and complete
          information in response to our questions, and you must keep that
          information current. You are fully responsible for all activity that
          occurs under your Native Account, including for any actions taken by
          persons to whom you have granted access to the Native Account. We
          reserve the right to change the account type, suspend or terminate the
          Native Account of anyone who provides inaccurate, untrue, or
          incomplete information, or who fails to comply with the account
          registration requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Native Account and digital wallet is your responsibility. While
          your Native Account enables you to access your wallet with ease,
          Native has no access to your wallet or any control over its use, and
          accordingly Native has no liability whatsoever regarding the use of
          your wallet. Access to your wallet (and any Community Tokens or Native
          Tokens held in it) is available only with the access information and
          codes issued to you when establishing the wallet. When creating a
          Native Account, your wallet&rsquo;s encrypted password file is
          encrypted once more before is stored in a protected file, accessible
          only by your password. We do not see, track, save or have access to
          your password which can unlock the password protected file. When
          choosing a password for your wallet, remember that your wallet may be
          subject to hacking attempts, and wallets with strong passwords are
          less easily attacked. You can always access your wallet using your
          access information, even if at any time your access to the Services is
          be disabled for any reason whatsoever. You acknowledge and accept that
          you are solely responsible for the security of your wallet and for any
          use of your Native Account. Native will not be liable or accountable
          for any loss or damage regarding your failure to keep your Native
          Account or wallet access information secret and protected.
          Furthermore, Native has no control over your actions or transactions
          made using the Services.
        </p>
        <p>5. Revisions, Disclosures and Notices</p>
        <p>
          We may amend these Terms at any time with notice that we deem to be
          reasonable under the circumstances, by posting the revised version on
          our website or communicating it to you through the Services (each a
          &ldquo;Revised Version&rdquo;). Each Revised Version will be effective
          as of the time it is posted, but will not apply retroactively. Your
          continued use of the Services after the posting of a Revised Version
          constitutes your acceptance of such Revised Version. Any Dispute (as
          defined in Section 22) that arose before the changes will be governed
          by these Terms in place when the Dispute arose.

          algorithms; decreased community or miner support for Ethereum; rapid

        <p>15. Risks</p>
        <p>
          Native provides an execution-only service and does not advise on the
          merits of any particular transaction or its tax or legal consequences.
          As a general matter, you should be aware of the following prior to
          utilizing our Services:
        </p>
        <ol start="1">
          <li>
            Understanding tokens and cryptocurrencies requires advanced
            technical knowledge. Tokens are often described in exceedingly
            technical language that requires a comprehensive understanding of
            applied cryptography and computer science in order to appreciate
            inherent risks. In using the Services, you represent that you have
            been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your own
            independent appraisal and investigations into the risks relating to
            and concerning the Native Tokens or Community Tokens. You represent
            that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication,
            professional advice and experience to make your own evaluation of
            the merits and risks of the Native Tokens or Community Tokens.{' '}
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p />
        <ol start="2">
          <li>
            You accept the risk of converting cryptocurrency into Native Tokens,
            converting Native Tokens into Community Tokens, and the redemption
            of Native Tokens or Community Tokens. You understand that such
            conversion or redemption may use untested code and protocols, and
            accept the risk of conversion failure or fault. You accept the risk
            that the Native Reserve or Community Reserve may not be sufficient
            to satisfy redemptions of Native Tokens or Community Tokens. You
            agree not to hold Native accountable for any related losses. Neither
            you nor we, can reverse, change or cancel a conversion of fiat or
            cryptocurrency into Native Tokens if such transaction is marked as
            complete or pending. Such conversion rate is determined by the
            Bancor algorithm and validated and recorded through the Ethereum
            blockchain. You understand that your public address will be made
            publicly visible whenever you use the Services.{' '}

            You are responsible for complying with applicable law. You agree
            that Native is not responsible for determining whether or which laws
            may apply to your use of the Services, including with respect to tax
            or other regulations. You are solely responsible for reporting and
            paying any taxes arising from your use of the Services.{' '}

            You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges.
            Native may experience sophisticated cyber-attacks, unexpected surges
            in activity, or other operational or technical difficulties, which
            may hinder the use of the Services or affect or even cause faults or
            failures in the conversion of fiat or cryptocurrency into Native
            Tokens or the redemption of Native Tokens. You agree not to hold
            Native accountable for any related losses.{' '}

            Native does not advise on the risks of conversion or redemption. If
            at any point Native or its representatives do provide
            recommendations, or any other information, the act of doing so is
            incidental to your relationship with us and imposes no obligation of
            truth or due diligence on behalf of Native or its representatives.{' '}

            We do not own or control the underlying software protocols, which
            govern the operation of the Native Tokens and Community Tokens
            supported on our platform. You acknowledge and agree (a) that the
            underlying protocols may be subject to sudden changes in operating
            rules (&lsquo;forks&rsquo;), and that such forks may materially
            affect the value, function, and even the name of the Native Tokens
            or Community Tokens you store. In the event of a fork, you agree
            that we may suspend the Services (with or without advance notice to
            you) and that we may decide whether or not to support (or cease
            supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely. You
            acknowledge and agree that we assume absolutely no responsibility
            whatsoever in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol;
            and (b) that we are not responsible for operation of the underlying
            protocols and that we make no guarantee of their functionality,
            security, or availability.{' '}

          respective employees, directors, agents, affiliates and

          fees) arising out of any claim, action, audit, investigation, inquiry,
          or other proceeding instituted by a person or entity that arises out
          of or relates to: (a) any actual or alleged breach of your
          representations, warranties, or obligations set forth in these Terms;
          (b) your wrongful or improper use of the Services; (c) your violation
          of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of

          embargoes; (f) you acknowledge and understand that Native is not
          acting as an exchange, broker, dealer, fiduciary, investment manager,

        </p>
        <p>
          UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL NATIVE BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE,

        </p>
        <p>20. Third Party Products</p>
        <p>
          All third party hardware and other products included or sold with the
          Services are provided solely according to the warranty and other terms
          specified by the manufacturer, who is solely responsible for service
          and support for its product. For service, support, or warranty
          assistance, you should contact the manufacturer directly. NATIVE MAKES
          NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO
          SUCH THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OR
          CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A

        </p>
        <p>21. Disputes</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo; are defined as any claim, controversy, or
          dispute between you and Native, its processors, suppliers or licensors
          (or their respective affiliates, agents, directors or employees),
          including any claims relating in any way to these Terms or the
          Services, or any other aspect of our relationship.
        </p>
        <p>22. Binding Individual Arbitration</p>
        <p>
          You and Native agree to arbitrate any and all Disputes by a neutral
          arbitrator who has the power to award the same individual damages and
          individual relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS
          WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS
          ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER
          ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE
          DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS
          ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR CONSOLIDATED
          ARBITRATION AGAINST NATIVE. If any provision of this arbitration
          agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be
          severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in
          no case will there be a class or representative arbitration). All
          Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding
          individual arbitration by a single arbitrator (the
          &ldquo;Arbitrator&rdquo;) administered by the American Arbitration
          Association&nbsp;(the &ldquo;Association,&rdquo; information about
          arbitration is available at https://www.adr.org)&nbsp;according to
          this Section and the Association&rsquo;s Consumer Arbitration Rules
          for claims relating to a transaction intended for a personal,
          household, or family use and its Commercial Arbitration Rules for all
          other transactions. The Arbitrator shall be responsible for
          determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including, without
          limitation, issues relating to whether these Terms and/or additional
          terms (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable or
          illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay,
          laches, or estoppel. Subject to applicable jurisdictional
          requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim in your local
          small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as your
          matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an
          individual (non-class or non-representative) basis. The Federal
          Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1-16, fully applies. If you are
          a consumer bringing a claim relating to a transaction intended for a
          personal, household, or family use, any arbitration hearing will occur
          within the county where you reside or at such other location as the
          Association may determine. Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will
          occur in Delaware or another mutually agreeable location. The
          arbitrator&rsquo;s award will be binding on the parties and may be
          entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. While an
          arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the Arbitrator
          may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking relief and
          only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
          individual party&rsquo;s claim. An Arbitrator&rsquo;s decision and
          judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel
          effect. Native will reimburse the arbitration fees due to the American
          Arbitration Association for individual arbitrations brought in
          accordance with this section for all claims totaling less than $10,000
          unless the Arbitrator determines that your claims were frivolous. You
          have the right to be represented by a spokesperson of your own
          choosing, at your own expense. &nbsp;If you prevail on any claim for
          which you are legally entitled to attorney&rsquo;s fees, you may seek
          to recover those fees in the arbitration. For any claim where you are
          seeking relief, we will not seek to have you pay our attorney&rsquo;s
          fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the Arbitrator
          determines that your claim was frivolous. For purposes of this
          arbitration provision, references to you and Native also include
          respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors,
          successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of
          the Services. Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration
          provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than
          small claims actions in consumer cases as discussed above) will be
          brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and
          venue of the Delaware state courts sitting in New Castle County, or
          the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.

        <p />
        <p>23. Governing Law</p>
        <p>
          These Terms and any Dispute will be governed by Delaware law without
          regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles and
          applicable federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act).
        </p>
        <p>24. Limitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute</p>
        <p>
          Any action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence
          within one year after the cause of action accrues.
        </p>
        <p>25. Assignment</p>
        <p>
          These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be
          transferred or assigned by you and any attempted transfer or
          assignment will be null and void.
        </p>
        <p>26. Third Party Services and Links to Other Websites</p>
        <p>
          You may be offered services, products and promotions provided by third
          parties and not by Native, including, but not limited to, third party
          developers who use Native&rsquo;s services (&ldquo;Third Party
          Services&rdquo;). If you decide to use Third Party Services, you will
          be responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and
          conditions for these services. We are not responsible or liable for
          the performance of any Third Party Services. Further, you agree to
          resolve any disagreement between you and a third party regarding the
          terms and conditions of any Third Party Services with that third party
          directly in accordance with the terms and conditions of that
          relationship, and not Native. The Services may contain links to third
          party websites. The inclusion of any website link does not imply an
          approval, endorsement, or recommendation by Native. Such third party
          websites are not governed by these Terms. You access any such website
          at your own risk. We expressly disclaim any liability for these
          websites. When you use a link to go from the Services to a third party
          website, our Privacy Notice is no longer in effect. Your browsing and
          interaction on a third party website, including those that have a link
          in the Services is subject to that website&rsquo;s own terms, rules
          and policies.
        </p>
        <p>27. Taxes</p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for determining any and all taxes assessed,
          incurred, or required to be collected, paid, or withheld for any
          reason for your use of the Services (&ldquo;Taxes&rdquo;). You also
          are solely responsible for collecting, withholding, reporting, and
          remitting correct Taxes to the appropriate tax authority. We are not
          obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate,
          collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from
          any transaction. Native specifically disclaims any liability for
          Taxes.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>28. Other Provisions</p>
        <p>
          These Terms, and any applicable additional terms or policies, are a
          complete statement of the agreement between you and Native regarding
          the Services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any
          other Native agreement or policy, these Terms will prevail and control
          the subject matter of such conflict. If any provision of these Terms
          or any additional term is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
          law, then it will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the
          objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under
          applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full
          force and effect. These terms do not limit any rights that we may have
          under trade secret, copyright, patent, or other laws. No waiver of any
          term of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of
          such term or any other term.
