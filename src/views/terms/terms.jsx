            liability company that was founded for the special purpose of
            developing a platform for communities (&ldquo;Communities&rdquo;) to
            generate independent currencies backed by a liquid reserve, enabling
            them to organize local economies (the &ldquo;Native

            currency called &ldquo;Native Tokens&rdquo; that is staked into
            Communities to generate &ldquo;Community Tokens&rdquo; that
            represent the value of a Community&rsquo;s economy.

            When you obtain Native Tokens through the Bancor smart contract in
            exchange for Ether (or certain other Ethereum-based tokens), 50% of
            the Ether is sent to the pool from which Native derives its
            operating funds (the &ldquo;Native Development Fund&rdquo;), and 50%
            is diverted to a reserve pool (the &ldquo;Native Reserve.&rdquo;)
            &nbsp;The Native Reserve has two primary purposes. &nbsp;First, it
            ensures liquidity for you or other users who wish to exchange their
            Native Tokens for Ether as they remove funds from the Native
            Platform. &nbsp;Second, it ensures that the price of Native Tokens
            (and, indirectly and partially, the prices of the various Community
            Tokens) remains tethered to the price of Bancor and that the prices
            of tokens used on the Native platform are intended to be relatively
            insulated from drastic price fluctuations. &nbsp;In sum, the value
            of the Native Reserve is substantially dependent on the market price
            of Bancor, a widely exchanged digital asset based on a decentralized
            protocol.{' '}

        <p className="c0">
          <span className="c4 c3">
            A similar bifurcation occurs when you obtain Community Token, with
            80% of the Community Tokens being sent to a pool of assets for use
            by the Community (the &ldquo;Community Development Pool&rdquo;), and
            20% of the Community Tokens sent to the a reserve pool used to
            assist with liquidity and price stability (the &ldquo;Community
            Reserve&rdquo;). &nbsp;As with the Native Reserve, the conversion
            rate for Community Token creation or redemption is determined solely
            by the Bancor algorithm, which takes into account a number of
            factors, such as the number of Community Tokens outstanding and the
            number of Native Tokens in the Community Reserve.

          <span className="c4 c3">
            You and Native agree to arbitrate any and all Disputes by a neutral
            arbitrator who has the power to award the same individual damages
            and individual relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE
            TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS
            ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER
            ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR
            CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A
            CLASS ACTION AGAINST NATIVE. If any provision of this arbitration
            agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will
            be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced
            (but in no case will there be a class or representative
            arbitration). All Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively
            by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the
            &ldquo;Arbitrator&rdquo;) administered by the American Arbitration
            Association&nbsp;(https://www.adr.org)&nbsp;according to this
            Section and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum. The
            Arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold
            arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these
            Terms and/or additional terms (or any aspect thereof) are
            enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to
            arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. Subject
            to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue
            your claim in your local small-claims court rather than through
            arbitration so long as your matter remains in small claims court and
            proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative)
            basis. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1-16,
            fully applies. If you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to a
            transaction intended for a personal, household, or family use, any
            arbitration hearing will occur within the county where you reside.
            Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in New York, or
            another mutually agreeable location. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award
            will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in
            any court of competent jurisdiction. While an arbitrator may award
            declaratory or injunctive relief, the Arbitrator may do so only with
            respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the
            extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual
            party&rsquo;s claim. An Arbitrator&rsquo;s decision and judgment
            thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect.
            Native will reimburse the arbitration fees due to the American
            Arbitration Association for individual arbitrations brought in
            accordance with this section for all claims totaling less than
            $10,000 unless the Arbitrator determines that your claims were
            frivolous. If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally
            entitled to attorney&rsquo;s fees, you may seek to recover those
            fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking
            relief, we will not seek to have you pay our attorney&rsquo;s fees,
            even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the Arbitrator
            determines that your claim was frivolous. For purposes of this
