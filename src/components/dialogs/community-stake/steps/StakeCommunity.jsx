            Welcome to the Alpha version of the Native platform. Here you can
            convert Ether to Native Token (NTV) and support any Community by
            converting NTV to their Community Token. By converting to Community
            Token you get to participate in Community votes about how to
            allocate funds, and earn Community Token in exchange for completing
            tasks that further the Communityâ€™s interests. The Beta version of
            the platform, which is scheduled for release by the end of Q1 2019,
            will enable you to convert from Community Token and NTV back into
            Ether and other cryptocurrencies.
